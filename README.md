# Frontend-Mentor---EasyBank

The project was to build an online bank landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

It was built using HTML5, SCSS & JavaScript.

The website is responsive. Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

This was made following Jessica Chan's FreeCodeCamp tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoQ6S1a32j8
